We value our time, and we value your time. Feel free to explain what you would do if you had more time. Please include all of the source code for your analysis in your report, and please describe all of the steps. We should be able to reproduce your analysis with little work using the content of your report."

    "This exercise asks some questions about a collection of records that simulate personal information such as name, address, and phone number. The associated data file contains records in JSON Lines format with one JSON object per line. The records contain nested fields, and different records might contain different fields. The high level concept of this exercise is to picture this data set as a structured table. Because each JSON record is independent, some or all of the columns in this table can have missing values. Below, we refer to the names of the columns in this table as named fields."

    "**Solution:** To parse the jsonl file, I used *json_normalize* from *pandas.io.json* and *jsonlines* packages. The *jsonlines* package could read the jsonl file line by line and the *json_normalize* package could parse the nested dict in jsonl file and concatenate nested field names using a period '.' to defind named fields for nested records. Unfortunately, the *jsonlines* package doesn't work for my Jupyter Notebook so I did it in python command. I parse the jsonl file and write the pandas dataframe into a csv file. Then I loaded the csv file in Jupyter Notebook for further analysis. I put my code in the markdown cell because I run it in the python commander. \n",

    "I reloaded the generated structured table to avoid the change of data due to the function call above and make sure the data is consistent. Since we have two different name fields (*name* and *name.firstname*), I considered the unique first names in these two fields just in case they have different unique names. First, I got the first name values as *name_split* from the field of *name* by spliting the string using delimiter ' ' and selecting the first element. I converted the type of the field of *name* to *str* because I want to align the new column with the other data and find the missing value ('nan') easily at the end. I used unique() method to obtain all distinct values from *name.firstname* and *name_split* but this method include missing value so I need to remove the missing value when I calculate the number of distinct first names at the end. I concatenate the distinct first names from *name.firstname* and *name_split* then used the unique() method again to get the final answer."

    "Similiar thought with last question, I extracted the street name from *address.street* and *address* and I extracted the street name and No. to *address_split_street* from the field of *address* first. I used the delimiter '\\r\\n' to split the street line and got the first element from the field of *address*. Then I found most the street name are the second and third word after the street number in the values of *address* and *address_split_street*. I wrote a function to extract the second and third word from the field but extract the second word only if the street name is short. I think the manager pre-cleaned the data and make it easier. Otherwise, the extraction of street name is a difficult task considering so many types of street addresses. I found some PO box addresses in the field of *address* which are extracted by my method but are not exactly street name. I will modify this in the future if I have more time. I assume the PO box are distinct values as well now. At the end, I concatenated the distinct street names from these two fields of *address_split_street_extracted* and *address.street_extracted* and got the distinct street names for both fields. The same idea as last question.\n",

    "For the first step, I used regular expression to match and extract the area code. For this dataset, the first three consecutive digits in the values of the field of *phone* are the area code because the prefix country code has a delimiter before the area code if existing. No matter the area code is in parentheses or using delimiter before or after, they always in a consecutive position. Therefore, I just need to extract the first three consecutive digits. This is not valid if there is no delimiter between country code and area code, for example, '+11234567890' but we don't have such case here. If I meet this case in the future, I could first judge the number of digits then extract the consecutive digits from position 2 to position 4. Also, I don't match the phone number in US only because I assume the majority of phone are from US since they don't have a prefix country code. I will check the country code in the future. After extracting area code, I used the same method of value_counts() as question 2 to find the 5 most common US area codes."
